# Project Description
This is a project in which I have used the API of Google Gemini to create a web app which can process both text and image and provide a response based on the text or image uploaded by the user.
# Types of files and their purpose in the project
1) reqs.txt :- This is a text file which has the required libraries for the project.
2) Multi-mode_main_app.py :- This is the main project which as the code for the integrated image & text (multi-model) A.I.
3) chat.py :- This is the file for chatting bot A.I between user and the A.I which stores the chat history as well.
4) text-ai.py :- This is a basic text A.I using gemini-pro.
5) vision.py :- This is the separate only image based A.I using gemini-pro-vision.
# Necessary Know-How to run the web app.
You need to create a .env file in your project folder so as to store the Google API key.
I have not uploaded my API key for security reasons. 
Please create and put your own API key to run the code.
